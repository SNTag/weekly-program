* version history
** 1.0.0
Functional.  Will do a simple symlink to the photos (regardless of file type) into a generated directory, sorting them as directed by a 'config.csv'
* Future Modifications
** Better File Support
*** Add recognition of RAW files, and do not symlink.  Instead, generate a list of the files that are RAW, and ask for conversion (or do the conversion if possible using RAWtherapee).
**** Could add an extra function for the sorting of RAW files? Don't see much need right now
*** Same concept with side-car files (*.CR2.pp3)
** Add PYQT5 interface
*** Possible side-function development then is to add detection or setting of a photo import from camera function
** Add extra Folder naming for Event if category exists
*** Add an extra column in config.csv for Event.  If exists, add it as a variable to the file name
